<br>
<br>
<blockquote>
Usage AWAY :<message>
</blockquote>
With the AWAY message, clients can set an automatic reply string for any
PRIVMSG commands directed at them (not to a channel they are on). The
automatic reply is sent by the server to client sending the PRIVMSG
command. The only replying server is the one to which the sending client
is connected to. The AWAY message is used either with one parameter (to
set an AWAY message) or with no parameters (to remove the AWAY message).

<br>
Nova does not support this command. Use the main IRC window for this.
